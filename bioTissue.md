## Finite deformation analysis and optimization of bio‐inspired materials
* Developed an efficient homogenization‐based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.
* Parallelized the optimization algorithm and executed the program on Unix‐based HPC clusters.
* Research results are featured by the Global Medical Discovery website
