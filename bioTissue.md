## Finite deformation analysis and optimization of bio‚Äêinspired materials

* Bio-inspired unit cell architectures successfully target chordae tendinea response.

* Geometric/material parameter roles are identified by micromechanics and optimization.

* Mimicking complex microstructure tissues by simple architectures is shown feasible.

* Defect criticality of optimum unit cell architectures increases with extensibility.

* Research results are published in [Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-the-mechanical-behavior-of-biomedical-materials/) [pdf file](JMBBM-2013-WenqiongTu.pdf) and featured by [Global Medical Discovery](https://globalmedicaldiscovery.com/key-scientific-articles/targeting-finite-deformation-response-wavy-biological-tissues-bio-inspired-material-architectures/)
