## Homogenized Moduli Evaluation of Periodic Materials with Finite-Volume Micromechanics and Abaqus

FVDAMâ€™s accuracy  and efficiency in computing homogenized properties and local stress fields are verified with Abaqus.  

Python scripting capability in Abaqus makes it possible to automate the imposition of periodic boundary conditions via coupling equations
