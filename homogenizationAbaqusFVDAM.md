## Homogenized Moduli Evaluation of Periodic Materials with Finite-Volume Micromechanics and Abaqus [pdf poster](/DS Simulia RUM Poster-Wenqiong Tu.pdf)

* FVDAMâ€™s accuracy  and efficiency in computing homogenized properties and local stress fields are verified with Abaqus.  

* Python scripting capability in Abaqus makes it possible to automate the imposition of periodic boundary conditions via coupling equations

*Results: Homogenized Properties* <br>
Note: FVDAM uses generalized plane strain analysis to generate the entire set of properties while a 3D mesh is used in Abaqus - hence the difference in execution times.
