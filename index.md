### About me

Welcome to Wenqiong (Wen)'s webspace! Also I can be spotted at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenqiong) and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=u28-S4gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

I am a PhD candidate in the program of Applied Mechanics under the supervisor of Professor [Marek-Jerzy Pindera](http://cee.virginia.edu/marekjerzypindera/) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/). My PhD research is focused on damage modeling and optimization of composite materials and now I am doing a six-month (June-Nov 2015)  internship  with Dassault System Simulia Corp.. I have established excellent skills in structural/stress analysis, programming as well as optimization.

**Skills:** <br>
**Simulation tools:** Abaqus, 3DEXPERIENCE Platform, Isight, fe-safe, ANSYS, LS-DYNA, HyperMesh <br> 
**Programming languages:** Matlab, Python, Fortran 

### Project highlights:


* ## [Development of Cohesive Zone Model-Based Finite-Volume Homogenization technique towards damage evolution in periodic materials](/sic_ti.html) 

* ## [Transverse and interfacial cracking in cross-ply graphite-epoxy laminates](/laminateDamage.html) 

* ## [Finite deformation analysis and optimization of bio‚Äêinspired materials](/bioTissue.html) 

* ## [Delamination simulation of fiber/Aluminum laminates under low-velocity impact in LS-DYNA](/dynaImpact.html)

* ## [Strength optimization of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) joints via ANSYS and Particle Swarm Optimization method ](/strengthOptimization.html)
