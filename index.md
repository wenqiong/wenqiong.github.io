### About me

Welcome to Wenqiong's webspace! 

Currently, I am a PhD candidate in the program of Applied Mechanics in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Virginia and expected to graduate at May 2015.



### My research

This is my research below:

## Project 1: Investigation of damage evolution in composite materials with finite volume homogenization
* Developed a highly efficient numerical tool in modeling crack initiation and growth with excellent stability.
* Simulated fiber/matrix debonding in SiC/Ti composites and damage evolution in cross-ply laminates.
* One peer-reviewed article has been published and two sequential papers are in the writing process.

# Example 2: damage evolution in cross-ply graphite-epoxy laminates



## Project 2: Finite deformation analysis and optimization of bio‐inspired materials (Journal paper)
* Developed an efficient homogenization‐based Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method.
* Parallelized the optimization algorithm and executed the program on Unix‐based HPC clusters.
* Research results are featured by the Global Medical Discovery website (link)
