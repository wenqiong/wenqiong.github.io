### About me

Welcome to Wenqiong's webspace! 

Currently, Wenqiong is a PhD candidate in the program of Applied Mechanics in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Virginia and expected to graduate at May 2015.

Wenqoing majored in Engineering Mechanics, which provides him a comprehensive understanding in structural analysis, experimental testing and mechanical design. During his master and PhD studies, he has established an exceptional background in structural and stress analysis, and analysis, design and optimization of heterogeneous materials, such as fiber reinforced composites, biomaterials.



### Research highlights:

* ## [Development of Cohesive Zone Model-Based Finite-Volume Homogenization technique towards the modeling of damage evolution in periodic materials](/sic_ti.html) 


* ## [Transverse and interfacial cracking in cross-ply graphite-epoxy laminates](/laminateDamage.html) 


* ## [Finite deformation analysis and optimization of bio‚Äêinspired materials](/bioTissue.html) 

* ## [delamination of fiber/Aluminum laminates under low-velocity impact](dynaImpact.html)
