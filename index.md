### About me

Welcome to Wenqiong (Wen)'s webspace! Also I can be spotted at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenqiong) and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=u28-S4gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in the program of Applied Mechanics under the supervision of Professor [Marek-Jerzy Pindera](http://cee.virginia.edu/marekjerzypindera/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) and now I am actively seeking a CAE or FEA Engineer Position that allows me to utilize my established simulation expertise and in-depth knowledge of solid/structural mechanics.

My Ph.D. research is focused on damage modeling and optimization of composite materials, which enables me to develop excellent simulation, analytical and programming skills and an in-depth understanding of material behaviors. Also, I conducted a six-month internship between June-November 2015 with [Dassault System Simulia Corp.](http://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/). The internship, mainly focused on Abaqus’s application, provided me a great opportunity to exercise the fundamental knowledge I had acquired during my university studies and to gain industrial experience efficiently through independent work and collaboration with Abaqus experts. 

**Qualifications:** <br>
1) Over 6 years of experience in finite element analysis with Abaqus, ANSYS, LS-DYNA <br> 
2) Extensive experience in programming with MATLAB and Python, optimization and analysis of composite materials  <br> 
3) Excellent analytical skills and deep understanding of fundamental physics and material behaviors <br> 
4) Familiarity with HyperMesh, fatigue analysis via fe-safe, Vibration Analysis, optimization via Isight and Tosca, and design via CATIA, AutoCAD <br>
5) Problem-solver with 9 journal articles and 4 peer-reviewed conference papers in structural and material modeling <br> 

**Skills:** <br>
**Simulation tools:** Abaqus, ANSYS, LS-DYNA, fe-safe, Isight, Tosca, 3DEXPERIENCE, HyperMesh <br> 
**Programming languages:** Matlab, Python, Fortran <br> 
**CAD design:** CATIA, AutoCAD
