## Transverse and interfacial cracking in cross-ply graphite-epoxy laminates [pdf poster](/CEE-Poster-Wenqiong Tu.pdf)

* CZM-Based Finite-Volume Homogenization offers a unified methodology for simulating damage in cross-ply composite laminates due to cracking or progressive interfacial degradation. 

* Different effects are taken into account, such as residual stresses, presence of interfacial resin-rich region and variable strength of the 90 degree plies.

* Transverse and through-thickness Poisson’s ratios are sensitive to different damage modes, which can serve as excellent damage detection indicators.
